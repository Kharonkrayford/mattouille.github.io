      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer with a strong background in systems engineering. Much of my late career has been around working in reliability, automation, and operations. I currently work at a start-up called Capstone Metering where I lead our Software Engineering department.
In my work life I subscribe to many extreme programming philosophies and aim to empower teams of both software and systems engineers. I like to use code to make my life either more simple or enjoyable, sometimes nailing both at the same time.</description>

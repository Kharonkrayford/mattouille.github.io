      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard, last Wednesday it was revealed that Trustico, a large reseller of TLS certificates, violated customer trust by emailing another reseller 23,000 of their customer private keys. That&amp;rsquo;s really the gist of what they did, what these articles don&amp;rsquo;t really cover is the underlying reasons why this is directly bad and why what it means is even worse.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-10-16-s3-bucket-security-and-best-practices %}&#34;&gt;S3 Bucket Security and Best Practices&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with how to extend security within a given AWS account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policies and KMS are great but to me assurance comes in threes. That said I don&amp;rsquo;t see VPC Endpoints discussed very much when people are talking about S3 Bucket Security, especially for something that&amp;rsquo;s served over a public API!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Basic Ubuntu Security</title>
      <link>https://mattouille.com/articles/2017-02/basic-ubuntu-security/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Especially in 2017 everyone should be concerned about security. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to be a genius or completely paranoid in order to avoid most potentially compromising situations. Follow these instructions and you&amp;rsquo;ll have a basic understanding of what it is to secure your brand new, vanilla Ubuntu server. That said, if you use the web or have a publicly accessible service then there is always a chance you will be compromised. You cannot predict application patches with vulnerabilities or the colorful attempts a hacker that is specifically targeting you may employ. You may simply prep with your best effort. Let&amp;rsquo;s begin!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

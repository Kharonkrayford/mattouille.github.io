      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently posted on Facebook that I was ditching Facebook and all of the apps dependent on it. While Spotify isn&amp;rsquo;t inherently dependent on it, I also wanted the opportunity to use Google Music for some of my favorite podcasts. Thus, I made the decision that Spotify was going down too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Migrating from Spotify to Google Play Music is already kind of a difficult task. I&amp;rsquo;ve had years of being on Spotify, to the point where I have 850 tracks on playlists and my library. I wanted a way to move my playlists I&amp;rsquo;ve built over the years over to Google Music. I found a service called &lt;a href=&#34;https://soundiiz.com&#34;&gt;Soundiiz&lt;/a&gt; that performs a very nifty function at a price of $4.95. It matches Spotify tracks to Google Play tracks and copies your playlist over. Unfortunately, I found that this only worked for playlists and not my music library. Thus, I took things into my own hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
